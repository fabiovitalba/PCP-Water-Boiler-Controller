# Build History
This photoseries gives a little insight into the build process of the water boiler controller.

### Reassembled water boiler
I removed all the insides from the water boiler and the heating circuit. The switch circuit was partially kept and cables were soldered on. The rotar potentiometer was glued to the underside of the water boiler switch.

### Rotary potentiometer at the bottom
The rotary potentiometer was placed at the bottom of the water boiler instead of its power supply. Two wires were put in place in order to give the potentiometer something to hold on to. The wires were later glued in place to avoid them falling out.

### Water boiler switch circuit
The water boiler switch circuit is very simple as it uses a plastic lever to connect the copper contacts to close the circuit. Two cables were soldered onto the copper contacts in order to read the closing of this circuit whenever the button closes.

### Arduino prototyping
The arduino was connected with the rotary potentiometer, and the switch in order to test first outputs.

### USB cable positioning
The USB cable was positioned at the very bottom of the water boiler handle in order to achieve a clean look, without immediately giving away the insides.

### Water boiler insides cleanup
Instead of the water boilers aluminium plate, which could not be kept since it contained the heating circuit and was simply too large, a cardboard piece was placed to hide the switch and provide a layer for the arduino to sit on.
Cables are funneled from the bottom through a small hole in the cardboard.

### Arduino placed on the inside
The Arduino is placed on the cardboard layer and connected with a mini breadboard that contains all the necessary circuits to read the outputs. A photocell was added in order to read the incoming light and provide additional outputs.
